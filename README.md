## Problem Statement

This program aims to search for a given number within a 2D array and determine its occurrence position.

### Main Points

1. **Input Rows and Columns**: The program prompts the user to input the number of rows and columns for the 2D array.
2. **Array Initialization**: It initializes a 2D array based on the user-provided dimensions.
3. **Input Elements**: Users input elements into the array.
4. **Search Element**: The user is prompted to specify the element to be searched within the array.
5. **Search Algorithm**: The program iterates through the array to find the specified element.
6. **Output Position**: If the element is found, it displays the position(s) where it occurs in the array.
7. **Flag for Existence**: A flag variable is used to indicate whether the element is found or not.
8. **Output of Results**: It prints the results of the search, indicating whether the element is present or not and its position(s) if present.
9. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is not implemented in this code.
10. **Exit**: The program terminates after displaying the search results.

### Fundamentals of the Code

- The program utilizes nested loops to iterate through each element of the 2D array.
- It employs a flag variable to track the existence of the specified element within the array.
- User input is utilized to define the dimensions of the array and input its elements.
- After the search is completed, the program outputs the results indicating the presence or absence of the specified element and its position(s) if found.
